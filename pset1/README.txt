------------------------------
YOU MUST FILL OUT THIS FILE BEFORE SUBMITTING!

OTHER COLLABORATORS (i.e., not your partner) AND CITATIONS (if any):

No collaborators. I needed to completely understand pointer aritmetic, allocation, and all aspects of this assignment.
Now I am more confident about those things =)

NOTES FOR THE GRADER (if any):

Test030 is failing and Heavy hitter reports not implemented due lack of time!
As for code style, I tried to keep consistent with existing code, but was unable to deliver the solution on "tens of lines", but rather "hundreds of lines".

RESUBMIT GRADE ME

On this version, I implemented heavy hitter reports.
Only hhtest.c and m61.h were modified. Thank you!
